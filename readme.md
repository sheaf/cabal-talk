# Haskell Ecosystem Workshop: Cabal

[Slides](https://sheaf.github.io/cabal-talk) and supplementary material
for my talk at the Haskell Ecosystem Workshop (June 2024), talking about a
new architecture for `Cabal` and `build-type: Hooks`.

To build the examples, you will need `cabal-install >= 3.13`.

The Haddocks for `Cabal-hooks` is bundled with this repository
[here](https://sheaf.github.io/cabal-talk/docs/Cabal-hooks/Distribution-Simple-SetupHooks.html),
as it is not yet uploaded on Hackage.
